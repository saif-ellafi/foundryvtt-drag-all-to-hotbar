# JV's Drag Anything To Hotbar for Foundry VTT

## Support for Foundry V10/V11 IMPORTANT NOTE
Allows to drag playlists, sounds, and compendium folders into the Macro bar. Also keeps actor and decks icons in it.

Originally, this module allowed to drag anything into the Macro bar.
Over time, as Foundry V10 and V11 came out, Foundry implemented this as part of their core functionalities;
the title of this module remains comprehensive for historical reasons :)
